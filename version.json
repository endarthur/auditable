{"version":"v0.3.0","notes":"## What's new\n\n- **Packed save**: notebooks can compress themselves via browser-native gzip. Split save button lets you toggle between normal and packed modes.\n- **Toolbar badges**: signed and packed status shown as badges next to the title.\n- **Module hygiene**: all ES modules are now pure (no side effects). A dedicated `globals.js` handles all `window.*` bindings.\n- **Release notes**: update panel now shows release notes when checking for updates.\n- **Build compression**: `node build.js --compress` produces a self-extracting packed build.\n\n## Fixes\n\n- Fixed multi-line imports not stripped by build script.\n- Fixed cross-module imports (`notifyDirty`, `S` in init, `setBadge`).\n- Converted inline `window.X` definitions in keyboard.js to proper exports."}
