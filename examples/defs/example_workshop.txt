Use the **prev** and **next** buttons below to navigate

Close this panel with the **\u00d7** button. Reopen it

    title: 'What is a workshop?',
    content: md`A **workshop** is a guided side panel that walks
users through a notebook. Call \`workshop(pages)\`
with an array of page objects and a panel slides in
from the right.

The workshop cell is typically \`// %collapsed\` so
it stays out of the way. Users see the normal notebook
layout but get step-by-step guidance in the panel.

Each page has a \`title\` and \`content\`. Content is
usually written with the \`md\` tagged template for
markdown rendering.`
  },
  {
    title: 'Pages & content',
    content: md`Each page is an object with \`title\` and
\`content\`. The \`md\` tagged template renders markdown:

\`\`\`js
workshop([
  { title: 'Intro', content: md\`**bold** and \\\`code\\\`\` },
  { title: 'HTML', content: html\`<em>raw html</em>\` },
])
\`\`\`

You can also use \`html\` for raw HTML content or
\`css\` for code display. The \`md\` tag is the most
common choice.`
  },
  {
    title: 'Gating progress',
    content: md`Add a \`canAdvance\` function to a page to
block the **next** button until a condition is met:

\`\`\`js
{ title: 'Task', content: md\`Set x to 5\`,
  canAdvance: () => notebook.scope.x === 5 }
\`\`\`

\`notebook.scope\` is a read-only snapshot of all cell
outputs. When any cell re-runs, the workshop
automatically rechecks gates. This enables interactive
exercises where users must complete a step before
advancing.`
  },
  {
    title: 'The notebook API',
    content: md`The \`notebook\` object lets workshops
interact with the notebook:

- \`notebook.cells\` \u2014 read-only array of \`{id, type, code}\`
- \`notebook.scope\` \u2014 snapshot of current variable values
- \`notebook.scrollTo(id)\` \u2014 scroll a cell into view
- \`notebook.focus(id)\` \u2014 focus a cell\u2019s editor
- \`notebook.addCell(type, code, afterId)\` \u2014 insert a new cell
- \`notebook.run(ids)\` \u2014 execute specific cells

The \`workshop()\` call returns
\`{ goto, toggle, recheck }\`
for programmatic control.`

# workshop workshop

a self-referential example: the side panel you see is itself a workshop, built from the collapsed code cell above. open it with the **workshop** tab on the right edge.

/// code
// try defining a variable — workshops can read notebook.scope
const x = 5;

/// code
// the workshop() builtin returns controls
// you can call w.goto(0) to jump to a page,
// w.toggle() to show/hide, w.recheck() to re-evaluate gates.
ui.display("open the workshop panel via the tab on the right edge →");
