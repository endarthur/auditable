# markdown interpolation

markdown cells support `${expr}` — expressions are evaluated against the notebook scope and update reactively when upstream values change.

/// code
const name = "world";
const count = 42;
const items = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"];

/// md
Hello **${name}**! There are ${count} things and ${items.length} items: ${items.join(", ")}.

/// code
const radius = ui.slider("radius", 5, {min: 1, max: 20});
const area = Math.PI * radius * radius;

/// md
A circle with radius **${radius}** has area **${area.toFixed(2)}**.

/// md
This markdown cell has no expressions — it renders as plain markdown with no DAG participation, same as before.
